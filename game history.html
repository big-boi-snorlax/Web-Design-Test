<h2>Early Development</h2>
<p>Among Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia, and the science fiction horror film The Thing. The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played Mafia since he was a kid. In the original game, function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house, aimlessly, while another person secretly killed the players, drawing a finger around their neck. Most of its mechanics were still present in Among Us, but the team wanted to "alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment". So, they decided that the game would be space themed and also added tasks, which, according to Forest Willard, programmer at Innersloth, "changed several times during development".</p>
<h2>Popularity Spike</h2>
<p>While Among Us released in 2018, it was not until mid-2020 that it saw a surge of popularity, initially driven by content creators online in South Korea and Brazil. Bromander stated that the game is more popular in Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea than the United States. According to Willard, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin first popularized the game on Twitch in July 2020. Many other Twitch streamers and YouTubers followed suit, including prominent content creators xQc, Pokimane, Shroud, Ninja, Disguised Toast and PewDiePie, and LazarBeam.</p>
<h2>Memes</h2>
<p>In August, Innersloth opened an online store for Among Us themed merchandise. The game's popularity inspired many original songs, fanarts and internet memes, Willard expressed that fan-created content "really is the best part" of making Among Us, and Bromander called it "my favorite thing to see". The game popularized the slang word "sus" (meaning "suspicious" or "suspect"), which had been used before the game's release. Other slang terms as well as internet memes popularized and inspired by Among Us include 'Sussy' and 'Sussy Baka' (derived from "sus"), 'When the Imposter is Sus' (an ironic meme based on Among Us, usually alongside an edited photo of Jerma985), and 'Amogus' (satiric misspelling of "Among Us").</p>
